THE BIG README

BUGS
* Fix the animation UI so that when you select a shape, it shows the right pivot point
* If you change the image ot what it already is, don't clear the shapes

FEATURES
* Rotation of shapes <- big one...

HOUSEKEEPING
* Clean up file structures
* Add a readme


FUNCTIONS

endShape() - finishes creating the shape after dragging
makeShapeEditable() - makes things draggable etc.
testIfGiffable() - checks to see if we can make a CORS request and make a GIF
savePic() - saves the picture
checkSendToBack() - checks if hte link to sending to back should be shown

FANCY SHIZ
* be able to offset the animations so they don't all run exactly the same

QUESTIONS
* Should clicking from the gallery just go to the Remix view right away?

GOOD WOBBLES TO REMAKE
*

TODO
* Fix the thing where if the image is narrow, it expands to accomodate the send to back link
* limit picker images to those only with likes?
* Less mixin for all of the animation styles
* Try not to show duplicates side by side in the gallery if they're the same
* Make it so that when the gallery is loading, the images don't start out tiny until they load
  (makes it kind of jarring when the happens.
