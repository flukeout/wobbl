Thoughts on z-index

We could start every shape with a z-index of 1000;
then when we press send to back... we could check the lowest z-index, and go one lower for the selected shape...

* Need to save z-index along with the shape property


Fancy shiz
* be able to offset the animations so they don't all run exactly the same
