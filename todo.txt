QUESTIONS
* Should clicking from the gallery just go to the Remix view right away?

ENHANCEMENTS
* Add a favicon
* Make sure it renders in mobile
  * Animation
  * Position

TODO
* Try not to show duplicates side by side in the gallery if they're the same
* Make it so that when the gallery is loading, the images don't start out tiny until they load
  (makes it kind of jarring when the happens.
* Fix animations in Safari

BAD UX
* It's really hard to grab the resize handle on large wobbling elements since it moves around
* Didn't see the "send to back" feature
* Limit the image size, probably set a max width / height and scale that shiz.

MOBILE MODE


REFACTOR
* Less mixin for all of the animation styles

BUGS
* Fix the animation UI so that when you select a shape, it shows the right pivot point
* If you change the image ot what it already is, don't clear the shapes
* If the image doesn't load, fail gracefully

FEATURES
* Rotation of shapes <- big one...
* be able to offset the animations so they don't all run exactly the same


HOUSEKEEPING
* Add a readme to the github repo
